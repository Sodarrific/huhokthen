                    Animation
                    <div class="dropdown-content space-grotesk-regular">
                        <p>I believe I started somewhere in elementary school and have kept learning, improving, and procrastinating since. I am able to work with different styles of animation, as my greatest flaw is my lack of consistency. I began with using Piskel, then I move to Krita, then Aseprite, and finally to Toon Boom Harmony, of which I have not mastered due to only having access to the Essential version.</p>

                        <p>Evidently, working with animation for years will attract the victim to things with good or intriguing animation or animation techniques. Stuff like inverse kinematics, implementation, lighting in a 2D environment and rigs to name a few. (Watch this video this is actually amazing https://youtu.be/BlU49dJhfcw)</p>
                        <p>In terms of items that aren't related to animation, exotic and pretentious stuff is my favorite to look into.</p>
